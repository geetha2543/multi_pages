    <p>piano, or pianoforte, Keyboard instrument with wire strings that sound when struck by hammers operated by a keyboard. It was invented in Florence by Bartolomeo Cristofori before 1720, with the particular aim of permitting note-to-note dynamic variation (lacking in the harpsichord). It differs from the older clavichord in that its hammers (rather than tangents) are thrown at the strings and bounce back, permitting the struck string to vibrate loudly. A cast-iron frame is needed to withstand the strings’ tremendous tension. Pianos have taken various shapes. The original harpsichord (or wing) shape has survived in the modern grand piano; the less-expensive square (actually rectangular) piano, standard in the early 19th century, was replaced by the upright piano, in which the strings are vertical. For at least 150 years the piano was the most important instrument in Western music.</p>

    <h2>History of Piano</h2>
    <p>A piano is a musical instrument that produces beautiful sounds when played. The sound is produced when the strings get stuck by hammers. When the keys of the keyboard are pressed, the hammers get activated and then the sound comes out.<br>

        This instrument was first found in the middle Ages and was known as Hammered Dulcimers, and it was a bit different from what it looks like now. The aim of Cristofori while manufacturing the prototype of the Piano was to make sure that while the strings touch the hammer, it does not stay attached to it but returns to its earlier position. If it remains attached, it can damp the sound, and this would stop from vibrating and ultimately, the sound won’t come out. So this means that after the strings get struck, the hammer is supposed to fall from the strings. Again the hammer is also supposed to get back without bouncing back violently. The position in which the hammer returns must be the one that would enable the key to play the same note repetitively with speed.</p>

        <h2>The Popularity of Piano</h2>
        <p>During the late 18th Century, the production of Piano started throughout Europe. There were various designs of Piano, and every country used to manufacture those different from others. The England Pianos are heavier, and the volume is much louder than the form of Austria. Those are much lighter, and the sound is also comparatively softer than the pianos of England.<br>

            The keys of the pianos also differ in terms of numbers. While the most common number of keys has 88 keys, other small pianos can have 85 keys.</p>
            <h2>Piano parts</h2>
            <p>A piano has a keyboard with white keys and black keys. When a key is pressed down, the damper comes off the string and a hammer hits the string. It hits it very quickly and bounces off so that the string is free to vibrate and make a sound. Each key is a level that makes a hammer inside the piano hit a string inside, producing a sound. Each string has a different length and so produces-a different note. When the player takes their finger off the key the damper falls back onto the string and the sound stops. The strings are stretched very tightly across the frame, passing over a bridge on the way. The bridge touches the soundboard. This means that the vibrations are sent to the soundboard. The soundboard is a very important part of the piano. If it is damaged the piano will not make a sound.<br>

                The mechanism which makes the hammer bounce off the string very quickly is called the “escapement”. In 1821 Sebastian Erard invented a kind of double escapement. This made it possible to repeat the note very quickly. The hammer only touches the string for about one thousandth of a second. The hammers are covered with felt which is a mixture of wool, silk and hair.</p>
