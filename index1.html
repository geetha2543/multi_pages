            Sitar is a plucked string instrument popularized by Hindustani classical music. The Sitar instrument is typically 1.2 meters, or four feet, in length and is played sitting down with the instrument held at a 45-degree angle. The body of the instrument is a hollow pear shape made from a gourd with a long, wide, hollow neck. Sitars can have between 18 and 21 strings that are attached to side- and front-tuning pegs at one end and to one of two bridges at the other.<br>

Sitar strings are made from wire of varying gauges. There are typically five to seven main strings that run along the raised, moveable frets on the neck of the instrument. There are also one or two drone strings used for rhythm and 10-13 sympathetic, or taraf, strings beneath the frets. Sympathetic strings vibrate independently when the main strings are played and produce a harmonic sound. The largest bridge, badaa goraa, is attached to the main strings and the drone strings, while a smaller bridge, chota goraa, is for the sympathetic strings.<br>

Sitars are often made from seasoned toon wood or teak. The resonator(s) are made from gourd—either pumpkin, calabash or a wood replica. Bridge styles and materials vary depending on the preference of the musician or instrument maker. The same is true of the tabli, or soundboard. Altering the bridge to affect the quality of sound is called jawari, and is often achieved by filing down the bridge to a specific curve.<br>
Originating in and popular throughout India, the sitar gained wider recognition in the 1950s through the music of famous sitar exponent Pandit Ravi Shankar. From the mid-20th century on, the sitar influenced worldwide rock, jazz, and pop music. In addition to sitars now being seen in multiple musical genres, many string instruments are tuned to imitate the sitar

        <h2>History of Sitar Instrument</h2>

        <p>
            The sitar instrument was developed in the 1700s following the Moghul Empire, taking elements from the instruments veena, Sehtar and tanpura that were popular at the time. The instrument was also inspired by long neck lutes that originated from Central Asia. Following its inception, the instrument gained popularity in Hindustani and Carnatic music, achieving its modern form in the 18th century.<br>

The invention of the sitar we know today is credited to Amir Khusru, an 18th-century fakir. Khusru’s grandson, Masit Khan, continued his grandfather’s influence on the sitar and its music. The playing style of Masitkhani Gat was named for his slow, melodic compositions that influenced much of early sitar music. In the 19th century, the sitar underwent design changes by Amrit and Rahim Sen that are still in use today.<br>

The 20th century saw significant changes to the sitar, namely the two distinct instrument types named for modern Sitar pioneers. The Ravi Shankar and the Vilayat Khan are both similar but have key differences that can be found in the next section. Additionally, an electric sitar was developed in the 1960s and is typically used in pop, rock and jazz music.

        <h2>Sitar Mechanics</h2>
        <p> The sitar produces a number of different tones and pitches using different mechanics on the instrument. The melody strings can be tuned to different standards depending on the player's school, tradition or personal preference. Sympathetic strings tuned to the notes of the raga being played and are re-tuned for each raga. Each string is attached to a tuning peg that can be tightened to raise the pitch or loosened to lower it. The melody strings can be further fine-tuned by sliding a bead on each string near the bridge.<br>

            Additionally, the curved, metal frets along the neck of the sitar are tied on, making them moveable. The frets can be positioned to achieve one of the widest varieties of pitches of any string instrument. Drone strings are typically tuned to one pitch that is played continuously throughout a piece.</p>
