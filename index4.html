    <p>Everybody knows some type of a guitar. The guitar has own place in traditional art creation and it has also become popular in many favorite genres – from country, to blues, to rock music at various levels. Of course, it is always used a different style of playing the guitar in every genres and very often the guitar is also different in construction and design.<br>

        The guitar is a stringed musical instrument with the fingerboard, on which it is being played by the form of strum. Therefore, the guitar is also sometimes named as a strumming musical instrument. The guitar tone itself arises by the vibration of a tighted string either strumming with help of a plectrum (professional called as “plektr”) or fingers.

    <h2>Tuning of six-strings guitar</h2>

    <p>
        The classical guitar has six strings. It could seem, that it is not much, but these six strings hide wide sound register. The strings are tighted between zeroth fret on the neck of the guitar and the inset of bridge on the front resonant desk. They are mostly tuned according to the treble clef into the tones E, A, D, G, B, E.<br>

The basic range of tones that arise by shaking strings, you can expand or change by the way, that the player shortened the length of vibrating strings during the play. To do this the strings are pushing to fret. Of course, you probably all have seen it, how it works in practice. Anyway, check out our videos where you will appreciate not only the play itself, but also the unique sound of the double top guitar from luthier’s workshop Hrus.<br>

This traditional Central European luthier’s workshop specializes in the construction of double top guitars with a unique inner bracing. What does this mean? For easier understanding, imagine a classical acoustic guitar with a sound box in the shape of Arabic eight. Double top guitar needn’t visually differ in any way. But it looks a little different inside the resonant board. The front resonant board has a completely different structure and therefore completely different properties. In short, it jointly forms and transmits a much better resonance. In addition, in luthier’s workshop Hrus they have also developed a unique internal bracing of this front board, which achieved an even better sound.<br>

As one encyclopedia correctly pointed out: “The bracing is hidden inside the guitar body. It is hidden to the common vision of musician and audience. As if it was invisible and therefore irrelevant. The opposite is true. The bracing has a large influence on the guitar sound.”

    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
        The pitch produced by the guitar depends on the notes that the strings are tuned to. The strings of a guitar are stretched from the tuning pegs at the top of the neck to the resonator located on the body. Tightening a string causes the pitch to be higher and loosening it causes the pitch to be lower. The six-string guitar has a standard tuning of E-A-D-G-B-E, which is what is used for most modern tablature and music. However, the guitar is considered a transposing instrument, which means tablature doesn’t always correspond to notes played.<br>

Since the guitar is a popular instrument for improvisation and learning by ear, there is a large variety of alternate and improvised tunings. Open tuning, for example, is when the strings are tuned to a specific chord when strummed without any fingers on the fret. The strings of the guitar can also be tuned to the standard of another instrument, like the violin or the sitar. Some playing techniques even involve changing the tuning of the strings while playing.
