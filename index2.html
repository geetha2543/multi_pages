        The tabla is the most commonly played drum set in North Indian music. It is the instrument most frequently used to accompany vocal and instrumental music, and dance; whereas its primary function is to maintain the metric cycle in which the compositions are set. Though the tabla is essentially an accompanying instrument, the tabla players are also soloists in their own right, and many have vast repertoires of elaborate compositions handed down orally from generation to generation.<br>

The tabla takes its name from the tabl of Arabic origin. The general meaning of the term tabl is an instrument facing upwards, with a flat surface. Scholars opine that the term table of the English language has been taken from the term tabll Some are also of the opinion that the term tabl is not an Arabic word in origin, but is borrowed from the Latin tabula.<br>

In the beginning, the instruments which were egg-shaped or hemispherical, with skin stretched over the opening, which can also be called kettledrum, were called tabl. These were essentially martial drums, which accompanied the military expeditions of Muslims. Though made of metal, these kettledrums were originally derived from the pot drums of primitive men. Later they became rounded like the egg; this may have been an adaptation to facilitate carrying them on the back of a horse or a camel. Slowly it became a generic term used as a prefix for all types of percussion instruments, spread over in the Middle East, no matter what shape they are, i.e. the tabl-baladi, the tabl-turki, tabl-naqqara, tabl-migri, tabl-al-gawig, etc.

    <h2>Origin of Tabla and its importance</h2>
    <img src="tabla 1.jpg" alt="tabla"  height="165px" align="right"">
    <p>Tabla is a traditional percussion instrument belonging to the North Indian heritage. It is a part of North Indian classical music and has significant importance. It is an instrument that can be played individually as in solo performances and also it is capable to accompany different genres of music. As an instrument of the Indian heritage, it has great importance in accompanying vocals and other types of instruments. There are many theories regarding the invention of the tabla. The first assumption was that it was discovered by a drummer named Amir Khusru in the first half of the 18th century. The second assumption is connected with the Indian mythology which told that Lord Ganesh once while playing the parental Indian instrument pakhavaj, accidentally dropped it and that’s how the partition gave us Tabla. Tabla is considered as the next invention to the pakhavaj or a modified avatar of it. The syllables that are being played on tabla came out from pakhavaj. The sounds of pakhavaj are bolder and heavier in tone, whereas tabla is lighter in sound as compared to pakhavaj. Along with being percussive, it is also a melodic instrument as melodies can be played. Different scaled tablas can be kept together to produce some great melodies which are called a Tabla Tarang.<br>

        Being an instrument made from skin, it is played with the hands and fingers. The skin isn’t quite hard and nor very soft. Good quality skin is able to resist some harsh weather conditions. The middle portion (black portion) of the tabla is made of iron particles, water, and a special type of clay. It gives a metallic tone as iron is a part of it. The skin is usually made up of goatskin. There are a lot of woods out of which tabla is made such as Shisham, Neem, Mahogany out of which Shisham has the best quality. There are 8 “Gattas” which keep the stripes of tabla in tension.<br>
        
        Tabla nowadays is also played with different genres of music. The main specialty of this instrument is that it is capable of imitating any percussion instrument. There is a special moment of Tabla versus other instruments where a battle in playing which is often called a jugalbandi in Indian music is seen among various artists.<br>
        
        Tabla also has a great deal of importance in the accompaniment of dance. There are various Indian traditional dance forms such as Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Odissi, and many other south Indian dances. In all these dance forms, especially in North Indian dance Kathak, the tabla is popularly used for accompaniment. There are various phrases that are sung by dancers while dancing and at the same time played on tabla. In vocals too, the tabla is used in showing the tala to the singer. In every type of tempo, the tabla is used with different moods. Along with that, it is also seen in light music. There are many regional vocal styles where tabla is used.<br>
        
        Even in folk music, the tabla is popularly seen. There are a lot of regional kinds of music where tabla is needed as the main percussion instrument. In typical folk music where there are regional percussion instruments such as ghunghroo, dholak, kartaal, khanjari, and dhol are used. Along with that tabla is also widely seen.</p>
        <h2>Tabla Mechanics</h2>
        <p>While many percussion instruments and drums are unpitched, both drums of the tabla have a limited tuning range. This versatile ability makes the tabla unique and desirable as a rhythm accompaniment. To some degree, the size of the drum determines the range of pitch it is capable of—with larger or heavier materials producing a lower pitch and smaller or lighter materials producing a higher pitch.<br> 

            The skins stretched across both drums are secured with loops of leather at high tension. Tuning blocks, called ghatta, are inserted into the loops of the dayan. The blocks are moved up or down to change the tension, and therefore pitch, of the drum head. The edge of the skin is secured with braided laces and these can be struck with a small hammer to fine tune the drums.<br>
            These tuning methods, in addition to playing techniques, allow for the pitch of the tabla to be altered depending on the composition. In the classical tradition, the smaller dayan is tuned to the ground note of the raga being played with the deeper bayan tuned an octave below.<br> 

The composition, size, and placement of the syahi, or tuning paste, also affects pitch and tone. The paste is typically a mixture of rice, water, and iron shavings and is applied by an expert. The mixture adds weight to the head of the drum, which alters the speed of vibration. The location of syahi on the drum head usually depends on the school of technique being used.
